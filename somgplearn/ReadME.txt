Somgplearn is an attempt to implement the sympy into gplearn
GPlearn program.py was modified so that it accepts genetic.py to directly access the program

Attempt Implementation

1.Access the program inside population list
2.Turn list expression ( program object has list data structure ) to string
3.Parse the string into sympy

Problem

Sympy cannot accept large string and output an error that is not related
